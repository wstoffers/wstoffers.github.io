### [The Texas Crutch](https://wstoffers.github.io/owlbearBbq/)
This project combines data from IoT sensors and various APIs in an around-the-clock GCP pipeline to extract capital improvement insights by way of Bayesian inference. Real-world issues encountered along the way required the addition of more complicated pipeline features.

### [Reducing R.I.S.C.](https://wstoffers.github.io/codex/)
This project uses natural language processing to extract features from recipes, classifying the recipes as their root form. The model will first be served in a Flutter app, setting the stage for a recommender, based on user palates.

## About

Shortly before DJ Patil (claims to have) coined the term Data Scientist, I had to pick a college major. I just went after the hardest computational problems I could find. And while my computational aerodynamics career has treated me really well, the years have seen me drawn to the agile and cutting edge world of Tech. Luckily, I can apply essentially the same skills, now to problems that affect the people around me more directly. And there still gets to be a little fun learning along the way - isn't learning the best?

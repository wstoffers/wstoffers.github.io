## About

Shortly before DJ Patil (claims to have) coined the term Data Scientist, I had to pick a college major. I just went after the hardest computational problems I could find. And while my computational aerodynamics career has treated me really well, the years have seen me drawn to the agile and cutting edge world of Tech. Luckily, I can apply essentially the same skills, now to problems that affect the people around me more directly. And there still gets to be a little fun learning along the way - isn't learning the best?
